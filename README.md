# kernel-rpm

kernel spec, config (based on fedora src.rpm) for upstream vanilla kernel rpms from kernel.org

built for and run/tested only on centos 7 x86\_64

# todo

- detect and generate EFI grub.cfg
  - ```/boot/efi/EFI/centos/grub.cfg``` on default c7
- probably need updated ```linux-firmware.spec``` from fedora as well
